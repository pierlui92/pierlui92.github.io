# Short Bio

Hi!

I am a researcher in Computer Vision and Deep Learning at the University of Bologna under the supervision of Professor Luigi Di Stefano.

I got my master and bechelor degrees in Computer Engineering in 2014 and 2017 respectively. 
In 2021, I received my PhD in Computer Science and Engineering. 

## Research Topics

Computer Vision and Deep Learning with focus on:

* Visual Perception (Depth estimation, semantic segmentation, optical flow) from single-modality or multi-modal sensors.
* Vision for Transparent and Mirror Objects
* Domain Adaptation and Generalization
* 3D Computer Vision (e.g., point cloud classification and segmentation)
* Neural Fields
* Anomaly Detection
