# Short Bio

Hi!

I am a post-doctoral researcher in Computer Vision and Deep Learning at the University of Bologna under the supervision of Professor Luigi Di Stefano.

I got my master and bechelor degrees in Computer Engineering in 2014 and 2017 respectively. 
In 2021, I received my PhD in Computer Science and Engineering. 

During the last years I have been investigating the potential of Deep Learning in a variety of Computer Vision topics such as Semantic Segmentation, Optical Flow, Depth Estimation, Novel View Synthesis, and 3D Reconstruction. I have also researched several techniques to train neural networks without real annotated data proposing several solutions which exploit computer graphics simulations, self-supervised or domain adaptation techniques.

## Research Topics

Computer Vision and Deep Learning with focus on:

* Depth Estimation
* Semantic Segmentation
* Optical Flow
* Domain Adaptation and Generalization
* 3D Reconstruction
